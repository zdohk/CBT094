Greetings Sam,

Check for these IBM APARS.

03/03/31 - IBM APAR OA02792 for assembly error in CSFSMF82
01/02/01 - IBM APAR OW47627 for assembly error in CSFSMF82

They are referenced in the change log.  Maybe I need a special place
to list all IBM APARs that affect DAF.  What do you think?

Michael
